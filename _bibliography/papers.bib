  title={Reducing Labeling Complexity in Streaming Data Mining},
  author={Yesdaulet Izenov and Srikanta Tirthapura},
  abstract={Supervised machine learning is an approach where an algorithm estimates a mappingfunction by using labeled data i.e. utilizing data attributes and target values. One of the majorobstacles in supervised learning is the labeling step. Obtaining labeled data is an expensiveprocedure since it typically requires human effort. Training a model with too little data tendsto overfit therefore in order to achieve a reasonable accuracy of prediction we need a minimumnumber of labeled examples. This is also true for streaming machine learning models. Maintaininga model without rebuilding and performing a prediction task without ever storing input samples arethe key concepts of streaming machine learning models. A successful and widely used streamingmodel is the Hoeffding tree which has large labeling complexity. In this work, we present FrugalHoeffding tree, a variation of the Hoeffding tree that uses less labeled data, and provides similarperformance as the original Hoeffding tree. We conduct experiments on large real-world datasetswhere we compare the performances of traditional batch decision trees, the Hoeffding tree andthe Frugal Hoeffding tree. We show that the Frugal Hoeffding tree consumes less labeled datayet can achieve classification performance similar to the Hoeffding tree.},
